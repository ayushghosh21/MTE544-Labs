# MTE 544 Lab 3 - Path Planning and Control
> By Group 8, Ayush Ghosh, Nick Shaju, Abhinav Agrahari


## Setup
To setup the `mte544_a_star` package, build and source this workspace: 

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
pip install scikit-image
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

## Running

In 4 seperate terminals:
- `ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch.py`
- `ros2 launch mte544_a_star mte544_a_star.launch.py`
- For defining goals in RViz:
  `ros2 run mte544_a_star mte544_navigation_client.py`

- For pre-defining a goal from terminal (modify x and y as needed): 
    `ros2 run mte544_a_star mte544_navigation_client.py --ros-args -p predefined_goal:=True -p goal_x:=4.0 -p goal_y:=0.8`

Then through RViz, give a `2D Pose estimate` and a `2D Goal Pose`

## Notes
- tf contains transform b/w odom and base_footprint. And also odom to map if given
- map to odom tf publisher in the launch file is altnerative to AMCL, to visualize map in ROS. This static tf assumes odom sensors are perfect and localization is perfect
- nav2_planner_server is actually the costmap sever
- params.yaml was generated by copy-pasting examples, and modifying topics to non-existant ones so not all Nav2 packages run

# Questions to ask
- Can we accept goal point through terminal as well? Why the initial pose portion?
- Should initial pose be through client, RViz, or hardcoded?
- Is A* planning correctly?
